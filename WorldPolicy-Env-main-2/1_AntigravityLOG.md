## 📊 PLAN STATUS SNAPSHOT — April 25, 2026 03:36 IST

### What's Already Done (Pre-Antigravity Session)

After reading every file in the project, here is the honest current state against the V6.1 plan:

---

### ✅ TIER 1 — Frontend (Feature 5: Debate Chamber Frontend) — ~85% DONE

The majority of frontend React components specified in the plan are already built as standalone JSX files wired into a single HTML entry point.

| `DebateTranscriptPanel` | debate.jsx | `/Proj/debate.jsx` | ✅ DONE — auto-scroll, focus filter, utterance rows with stance pills, SPEAKING indicator |
| `VoteBar` | debate.jsx | `/Proj/debate.jsx` | ✅ DONE — 3-bar vote tally, PASSED/FAILED badge |
| `CountryPnLLedger` | pnl.jsx | `/Proj/pnl.jsx` | ✅ DONE — 7-row table, 7 metrics, UNESCO heritage-only, flash-on-delta animation (600ms) |

- Full scripted P&L delta logic: each utterance updates GDP/welfare/influence on relevant rows
- Company ticker updates at scripted steps (GAZP crash, AAPL dip, Aramco spike etc.)
- 14-utterance debate script with realistic persona-driven speeches
- Rhetoric Cold War alert fires at step 31 (USA vs Russia consecutive OPPOSEs)

| `make freeze` shows all 7 OK | ❌ No freeze system exists |
| At least one live debate round renders cleanly within 20s | ✅ Demo runs, debate starts immediately |
| Country P&L ledger flashes on at least 3 utterances per round | ✅ Works in mock |
| UNESCO utterance cites a real article from `unesco_authority.json` | ❌ Cites hardcoded strings, no JSON corpus |
| `RhetoricColdWarAlert` fires at least once in Scenario 1 demo rehearsal #5 | ✅ Fires at step 31 reliably |
| Split Mode renders correctly at 1440×900 and 1920×1080 | ⚠️ NOT VERIFIED |
| Hovering and clicking portraits responds in under 200ms | ✅ Looks fast |
| Groq fallback (canned debate) is seamless if live call fails | ✅ Entire thing IS the canned fallback right now |
| ClaimBoundaryBanner is always visible | ✅ |
| All V5 emergent detector tests pass | ❓ UNKNOWN — no test runner found |
| HF Space is live and loads from presenter's phone | ❌ NOT DEPLOYED |

## 🚀 ANTIGRAVITY SESSION — Work Log

---

### [LOG-001] — 2026-04-25 03:36 IST
**Action:** Read all project files, analyzed V6.1 plan, created this log.
**Files Read:** `WorldPolicy-V6.1-WIN-Plan.md`, `WorldPolicy V6.1.html`, `worldpolicy.css`, `portraits.jsx`, `debate.jsx`, `pnl.jsx`, `chamber.jsx`, `debate-sim.jsx`, `sim.jsx`, `panels.jsx`, `globe.jsx`, `V6.1-claude-design-prompt.md`
**Finding:** Frontend is ~85% complete and looks impressive. Backend is 0% built. The demo will run fully from scripted data.
**Next:** Begin implementing missing pieces. Priority order below.

---

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION QUEUE (What I Will Build Next)

Given the hackathon deadline (April 26), here is the priority order. We focus on things that make the demo MORE IMPRESSIVE and VERIFIABLY REAL, not on backend infrastructure that requires infra setup.

### PRIORITY 1 — Make the demo unbreakable & verifiable
- [ ] **[P1-A]** Add `data/unesco_authority.json` — 20+ real UNESCO convention article stubs so UNESCO utterances cite real articles (not hardcoded strings). This fixes one non-negotiable quality bar.
- [ ] **[P1-B]** Add `personas/` directory with 7 persona markdown files (USA, CHN, RUS, IND, DPRK, SAU, UNESCO). These are needed for Groq integration AND they are impressive to show judges.
- [ ] **[P1-C]** Add `data/relationships.json` — 7×7 relationship matrix with plausible historical values.

### PRIORITY 2 — Backend (Groq integration)
- [ ] **[P2-A]** Create `persona_loader.py` — loads persona files
- [ ] **[P2-B]** Create `debate_orchestrator.py` — calls Groq Llama 3.3-70b, returns DebateUtterance stream
- [ ] **[P2-C]** Wire up FastAPI with `/stream/debate`, `/stream/country-pnl`, `/stream/company-pnl` SSE endpoints

### PRIORITY 3 — Frontend polish
- [ ] **[P3-A]** Add `CountryPnLLedger` to the SPLIT MODE layout (currently it's absent — only CompanyPnLStrip is in split mode)
- [ ] **[P3-B]** Add World Outcome Summary Card (Tier-2 feature, high judge impact)
- [ ] **[P3-C]** Cascade Failure → auto-trigger debate (Tier-2)
- [ ] **[P3-D]** Add "Generate Live Debate" button (wires to backend when ready, falls back to canned)

### PRIORITY 4 — Deploy & freeze
- [ ] **[P4-A]** Test at 1440×900 and 1920×1080 (layout verification)
- [ ] **[P4-B]** HF Spaces deployment
- [ ] **[P4-C]** Record sizzle reel

**[agent:gemini] [source:antigravity-cli] [action:plan] [by:antigravity] [scope:worldpolicy-v6.1] [ref:none]**
*Initial audit completed. Frontend 85% done, backend 0% done. Proceeding with P1-A: UNESCO authority corpus.*

---

### [LOG-002] — 2026-04-25 03:45 IST → 04:15 IST
**Action:** Completed all PRIORITY 1 backend data files.
**Files Created:**
- `data/unesco_authority.json` — 30 real UNESCO/Hague/Geneva convention articles, crisis→article mapping. Fixes the UNESCO non-negotiable quality bar.
- `personas/USA.md` — 40+ line persona: voice, red lines, alliances, crisis-adaptive shifts
- `personas/CHN.md` — Sovereignty-first, AIIB focus, non-interference doctrine
- `personas/RUS.md` — Cold, clipped, energy leverage, red-line rhetoric
- `personas/IND.md` — Strategic autonomy, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, swing-vote behavior
- `personas/DPRK.md` — Defiant, stark, short sentences, imperialist-calling
- `personas/SAU.md` — Transactional, energy rider on every commitment, discreet
- `personas/UNESCO.md` — NON-VOTING, authority-scoped, strict mandate constraints, article citation required
- `data/relationships.json` — Full 7×7 matrix with seeded historical values + grudge memory + coalition history
- `persona_loader.py` — PersonaLoader class: loads personas, builds LLM system prompts, manages relationship matrix updates
- `debate_orchestrator.py` — Full orchestrator: Groq integration (live + canned fallback), vote tally, audit log, rhetoric cold war detector, UNESCO mediator helper
**Status:** P1 ✅ DONE. P2-A ✅ DONE. P2-B ✅ DONE.
**Next:** P2-C (FastAPI server with SSE), then P3-A/B/C/D (frontend improvements).

---

### [LOG-003] — 2026-04-25 07:52 IST
**Action:** Resuming session. Starting P2-C (FastAPI server) and P3-A/B/C/D (frontend improvements).
**Plan:**
1. Build `server.py` — FastAPI with `/stream/debate`, `/stream/country-pnl`, `/stream/company-pnl`, `/live-debate`, `/persona/{id}`, `/relationship-matrix`, `/unesco-authority/{crisis_type}`, `/vote-outcome/{round_id}` endpoints
2. Add `CountryPnLLedger` to Split Mode layout in `WorldPolicy V6.1.html`
3. Add `WorldOutcomeSummaryCard` component + wire to episode end
4. Add cascade → debate trigger integration
5. Add "Generate Live Debate" button
6. Add `worldpolicy.css` ticker-scroll animation (currently missing)
**Working in:** `/Users/krish/Desktop/study/project/Proj/`
